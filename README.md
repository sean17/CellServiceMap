CellServiceMap
==============

Pending IRB approval and PhoneLab support, I would like to plot a cell phone signal strength map for the University at Buffalo, using data collected from Phonelab.

This project will consist of a front end using Google Maps.  This will receive an object containing cell signal strengths and their corresponding location.

The backend will (most likely) use node.js with redis store data.  This data will then be retrieved by node and given to the client.
